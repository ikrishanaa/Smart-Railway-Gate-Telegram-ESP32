## üí¨ Telegram Bot Setup

1. **Create Bot**
   - Open Telegram ‚Üí Search `@BotFather`
   - Type `/newbot`
   - Give it a name and username
   - You'll get a **BOT TOKEN** like:
     ```
     123456789:AAHfkGuwSdf1asfasdf...
     ```

2. **Get Chat ID**
   - Open your Telegram bot and **send any message**
   - Visit:  
     [https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getUpdates](https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getUpdates)
   - Look for:
     ```json
     "chat": { "id": 123456789, ... }
     ```
   - That `id` is your **Chat ID**

## üß† Working Principle

- When `/open` or `/close` is received on Telegram:
  - Servo moves slowly (2.5‚Äì3.8s) to open or close the gate
  - Buzzer starts with slow beeps and increases frequency
  - LED glows:
    - üî¥ while gate is closing or closed
    - üü¢ while gate is opening or open
- Before closing:
  - Both ultrasonic sensors check for objects within 20cm
  - If object found ‚Üí `Gate doesn't close`, Telegram sends `Object detected`
- `/status` shows current gate state and whether an object is detected.
