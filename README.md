## üì¶ Components Used

| Component                    | Quantity | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ESP32                       | 1        | Main controller board                            |
| Servo Motors (MG90s/SG90)   | 2        | To move the gates up/down                        |
| Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)| 2        | For obstacle detection on both sides             |
| Buzzer                      | 1        | For warning beep (increasing pitch)              |
| LEDs (Red + Green)          | 2        | Red = Gate Closing/Closed, Green = Opening/Open  |
| 220Œ© Resistor               | 2        | Current limiter for LEDs                         |

## üí¨ Telegram Bot Setup

1. **Create Bot**
   - Open Telegram ‚Üí Search `@BotFather`
   - Type `/newbot`
   - Give it a name and username
   - You'll get a **BOT TOKEN** like:
     ```
     123456789:AAHfkGuwSdf1asfasdf...
     ```

2. **Get Chat ID**
   - Open your Telegram bot and **send any message**
   - Visit:  
     [https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getUpdates](https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getUpdates)
   - Look for:
     ```json
     "chat": { "id": 123456789, ... }
     ```
   - That `id` is your **Chat ID**

## üß† Working Principle

- When `/open` or `/close` is received on Telegram:
  - Servo moves slowly (2.5‚Äì3.8s) to open or close the gate
  - Buzzer starts with slow beeps and increases frequency
  - LED glows:
    - üî¥ while gate is closing or closed
    - üü¢ while gate is opening or open
- Before closing:
  - Both ultrasonic sensors check for objects within 20cm
  - If object found ‚Üí `Gate doesn't close`, Telegram sends `Object detected`
- `/status` shows current gate state and whether an object is detected.
